DownFall is inspired by projects like [Xsnow](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xsnow/), [gsnow](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1156/gsnow/), and [Let it snow](https://bitbucket.org/matban/let-it-snow/src/master/), but with support for arbitrary text or Unicode emojis

## Enabling
Enabling the extension puts a toggle switch in the GNOME QuickSettings menu. Click the toggle switch to start/stop the extension. Configuration is currently done through the extension's settings menu

## Configuration
Text items can fall in eight directions on either the primary or current monitor:  
* Down (↓)
* Up (↑)
* Right (→)
* Left (←)
* Up-right (↗)
* Up-left (↖)
* Down-right (↘)
* Down-left (↙)

Additional configuration options include color, font, size, fall speed/time, rotation, and drift

DownFall can be used to render multiple effects such as:  
* Snow (Down-left ❄, ❅, ❆, *, .)
* Falling leaves (Down, Down-left, Left 🍁️, 🍂️)
