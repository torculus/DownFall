# DownFall
DownFall is a GNOME Shell extension that moves text items of your choice across the screen  

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torculus/DownFall/master/media/DownFall.mp4

DownFall is inspired by projects like [Xsnow](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xsnow/), [gsnow](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1156/gsnow/), and [Let it snow](https://bitbucket.org/matban/let-it-snow/src/master/), but with support for arbitrary text or Unicode emojis

Text items can fall in eight directions on either the primary or current monitor:  
* Down (↓)
* Up (↑)
* Right (→)
* Left (←)
* Up-right (↗)
* Up-left (↖)
* Down-right (↘)
* Down-left (↙)

Additional configuration options include color, font, size, fall speed/time, rotation, and drift

DownFall can be used to render multiple effects such as:  
* Snow (Down-left ❄, ❅, ❆, *, .)
* Falling leaves (Down, Down-left, Left 🍁️, 🍂️)
* Rain (Down, .,💧️)
* Meteorites / shooting stars (Down-right *, .)
* Japanese cherry blossoms (Down 🌸️)
* The opening crawls from Star Wars®
* Raining money (💰️,💵️,🪙️)
* Fireworks (Up, Up-right, Up-left ., *, |)
* Digital rain from The Matrix® series (ﾊ,ﾐ,ﾋ,ｰ,ｳ,ｼ,ﾅ,ﾓ,ﾆ,ｻ,ﾜ,ﾂ,ｵ,ﾘ,ｱ,ﾎ,ﾃ,ﾏ,ｹ,ﾒ,ｴ,ｶ,ｷ,ﾑ,ﾕ,ﾗ,ｾ,ﾈ,ｽ,ﾀ,ﾇ,ﾍ)
* And much more!
